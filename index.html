								<h2>Flies</h2>
								<p>Slow your gait. You’re the boat I wanna sail away. But you see mosquitoes in your eyes.</p>
								<p>Love’s all a bunch of giant crane flies, And they’re scarin’ us all alone, And afraid to die. You’re all alone on my brain tonight. I got a bag of tobacco I need your flame I need a light. You’re all alone on my brain tonight. You’re all alone on my mind.</p>
								<p>I’m thinkin’ ‘bout goin’ over the edge. I’m thinkin’ ‘bout goin’ or I’m already there.</p>
								<p>Don’t blow your sails. Far away from them big bombshells That I’m shootin’ high up in that sky.</p>
								<p>Love’s all a bunch of giant fire flies, And they’re scarin’ us all alone and afraid Babe I’m scared to die here without you. You’re all alone on my brain, in my head tonight. I got a bag of tobacco I need your flame Babe I need a light. You’re all alone on my brain tonight. You’re all alone on my mind.</p>

								<h2>The Good Kind</h2>
								<p>This man is the good kind. Yeah I might land on a hooked line, But I don’t get caught in the pocket. I don’t get mixed in the twist. I can’t pray through the damn wall, And I do play in a band called Me, But that wasn’t me in the dance hall. Not at all.</p>
								<p>This girl got the right stuff. Yeah she might stall at the junction, But she don’t be hoppin’ on no stray cars. She don’t get run off her tracks. She can’t pray like her baby do, And she do raise a little hair sometime She do raise a little hell sometime, Who could’ve seen it in her own mind. Nobody else but You.</p>
								<p>Our God is a sound one. Yeah he might give a little kick and push, Then go hide right by in that thicket brush. How that thicket hush. Naw he ain’t there everytime I call. He as shy as a newborn boy. Just as shy as a newborn boy. Screamin’ loud like a hawthorne flower. Think you can? You can’t ignore. No not at all.</p>
								<p>So she gonna raise a little hair and hell. I’m gonna play in a band and wail. While we ridin’ his coattails, And we might do this ‘til we gone.</p>

								<h2>Romans</h2>
								<p>We can do as the Romans, Or do as the Romans never did. We could fight like soldiers, We could wrestle like kids. We’ll think it over. Go on Pump our fists. Come on! Thank God, sober. But no no. We’ll moan and piss. We can do as the Romans, Or do as the Romans never did.</p>
								<p>We can do as the Romans, And live forever in time. But let’s just enjoy these moments we got. We got this one fuckin’ life. And though I hear it ain’t nothin’ like livin’ Yeah I hear it ain’t nothin’ like that And though I hear it ain’t nothin’ like livin’ with God, Til we’re dead on our backs But I still wanna live. We could live like Romans, And do as the Romans never did.</p>

								<h2>Wrecking Ball</h2>
								<p>Headbent silence, Beggin’ for guidance to come. Can’t wait to be grown and tall, Then here it comes like a wrecking ball.</p>
								<p>Here it comes. Cut your tube, set you loose, I’ll set you loose. That body gonna tire Body gonna bruise. Your body will bruise You’ll love that worn out woman, But you’ll find a girl to take you away. And all your little children, Gonna love your tired ass just the same.</p>
								<p>You’ll get used to it, Beatin’ on your own ear drums. It seems nobody comes, Nobody cares about nothin’ at all. We stuck, screamin’ at the top of our lungs. Scream it out the top of our lungs! Ah!</p>
								<p>You’ll love a wild woman, Cause who else gonna love you so mad. See all of your grandkids, And pray to God it won’t be as bad. Then here it comes. Here it comes oh yeah. But we just as tough. We just as tough as nails In a ten dollar bag.</p>

								<h2>Shovels</h2>
								<p>Friends grab your shovels, There’s a kid in the dirt, Screamin’ for his mother, Prayin’ she’s not hurt. Friends grab your shovels, A baby’s in the earth, Clingin’ to the others. Let’s bring ‘em through the turf.</p>
								<p>Yeah I see you here, And you’re beautiful as can be. It can’t be. But I got a spear, And I’m diggin’ as hard as You will let me. You’re beautiful to see.</p>
								<p>Friends grab your shovels. Cause you gotta dig. And fuckin’ dig. Come on fuckin’ dig. Friends grab your shovels, A baby’s in the earth. Singin’ for the Good Lord, Showin’ what you’re worth. Sing it for the Good Lord, Show Him what you’re worth!</p>
								<p>Cause I see you here, And you’re beautiful as can be. It can’t be. But I got a spear, And I’m diggin’ as hard as you will let me. You’re beautiful to Me.</p>
								<p>I know it’s there. You’re innocent. I know the snow that we are. Oh yes I know!</p>
								<p>Friend, grab your shovel.</p>

								<h2>Who I Was</h2>
								<p>It was then, by the river when the moon in light lit the smoke off the cinders You should have known First a crack, then a crumble And the traffic moan You should have known then who I was.</p>
								<p>And the sun, opened up just like confetti, and somewhere in that moment you should have known. And the world all burned up Just like gasoline. You should have known then who I was.</p>
								<p>It was then the dust settled and the rain that came killed the flame from the kettle you should have known. There are some things still blacker than a lack of light. You should have known then who I was.</p>
								<p>And the chord that was struck was unraveling. At the sound of it fading You should have known. And the peace between us was battling. You should have know then who I was.</p>

								<h2>Windburnt Soul</h2>
								<p>Don’t fade quiet and soft, To your dyin’ day. Don’t fade. Red-stained, windburnt soul Return to base.</p>
								<p>Don’t cower in your final hour, You old face Don’t cower in your final hour, Hold face. Red-stained, windburnt soul Return to base</p>
								<p>Go on an all-out run, Don’t watch your step. Leave your breath behind Let your babies cry. Leave your lady go dry.</p>

								<h2>Cleansing Sea</h2>
								<p>Salve Magister, You took on my features Feel the burning sun. Hold well Your beating drum.</p>
								<p>Blessed flesh that let You bleed Holy rivers to the Cleansing Sea.</p>
								<p>God the Spirit steer my ship, Strengthen my sail so it won’t rip. Tie our hands, scar these knees, Cause we don’t wanna go against Your breeze, Fly me to the cleansing sea.</p>
								<p>Well I know your sendin’ wind. I just gotta bend My body will bend like a bow And that arrow will fly. My body will die. God be! Goodbye</p>
								<p>Oh fly me to the Cleansing Sea.</p>

								<h2>Turncoats</h2>
								<p>Turncoat, cold hearted, Church leavin’ daughter of mine. Curse that boy’s old car, Your cheatin’ hearts go double time. Came back from Ann Arbor, Big as a Canton five and dime. Yellow ring on the wrong finger, Tellin’ us all the world bout Caroline How you ain’t felt her feet in a week. Gerard’s prayin’ hard that girl ain’t dyin’.</p>
								<p>Turncoat magi, give you your gifts commit your crimes Fugitive empress we want your gifts don’t you go hidin’</p>
								<p>Your Jacob is all for makin’ money, With plans to sim’ to mine. See your hardened mother, And my hard earned money ain’t farin’ right. Though she so pretty, your mom, Anything I seen in all my life. And oh the stone on her bone finger, Weighin’ that body down like Sisyphus. Though I ain’t touched her cheek in a week, Valentine just fine, my love ain’t dyin’.</p>
								<p>Turncoat magi, give you your gifts commit your crimes Fugitive empress we want your gifts don’t you go hidin’ from me.</p>

								<h2>Graces</h2>
								<p>Don’t miss that train comin’ home. Don’t miss that train to me. You’ll lose your train of thought. While those turnin’ wheels are doin’ their job.</p>
								<p>Hey you’re tearin’ along. And in my eyes you could do no wrong.</p>
								<p>You’re on a plane blowin’ smoke. Signin’ our names en caelo Curse the space between our agin’ faces. Curse the space, I need your graces</p>
								<p>Touch down. Tell me you love me still, Baby I will Love you. I will love havin’ you around. Curse the space between our faces. Curse the space I need your graces.</p>

								<h2>Hellion</h2>
								<p>Save me crazy girl, Show me your bed, Take me my world Read between these lines. Deep lines in my head. This old head of mine. The young gun soul I was, Dead to his rights. Them none the wise.</p>
								<p>Find that cub in me I don’t wanna be my dad no more. Find that hellion in me, I know he will be good to the core. Find that cub in me I don’t wanna be this man no more. Find that hellion oh-eee! I know he will be good to the Lord.</p>
								<p>Love that hellion in me, Carefully creepin’ out my head. I’ll find that cub in you. Oh I love you. I love you red.</p>
								<p>Find that cub in me, I know he will be good to the core. Tell that hellion it true That I love you. More than you’d ever care to know. And I know we will be good to the Lord.</p>
